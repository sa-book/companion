This site is intended to enhance your use of the book *Sequence Analysis* by Marcel Raab & Emanuela Struffolino. On this webpage we provide accompanying material illustrating how to conduct sequence analysis in `r fa_r_project(colour = "#384CB7")` using the [`TraMineR` package](http://traminer.unige.ch) [@knuth1984]. 

We also provide materials for Stata, although not as exhaustive, using the user-written ados `sq`[@knuth1984] and `SADI`[@knuth1984].    

Please note that most of the materials on this site are designed to be used in tandem with the book (which we clearly recommend to buy [once it has been published]).
