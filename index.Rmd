This site is intended to enhance your use of the book *Sequence Analysis* by Marcel Raab & Emanuela Struffolino. On this webpage we provide accompanying material illustrating how to conduct sequence analysis in `r fa_r_project(colour = "#384CB7")` using the `TraMineR` package. We also provide some materials for Stata users but the site's main focus is on applying sequence analsis in `r fa_r_project(colour = "#384CB7")`. 

Please note that most of the materials on this site are designed to be used in tandem with the book (which we clearly recommend to buy).
