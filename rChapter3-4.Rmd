The book covers the following metrics based on common attributes (that is, nonalignment techniques): longest common subsequence (LCS), number of matching subsequences (NMS), and the subsequence vectorial representation-based metric (SVRspell). The `TraMineR` documentation of the `seqdist` command offers detailed explanation of how to implement these dissimilarity measures.
